# My Github Activity

My GitHub Activity is a Chrome extension to help you manage your activity on GitHub.

## Installation

1. Get [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) if you do not have it (`npm install -g yarn`).
2. Run `yarn install`.
3. Run `yarn build`.
4. Go to Chrome > Menu > More tools > Extensions then choose "Load unpacked extension" and navigate to your repository and select the directory titled `build`.
5. Making changes locally is simplest to test via a browser window rather than the extension, so run in the browser, run: `yarn start`.
